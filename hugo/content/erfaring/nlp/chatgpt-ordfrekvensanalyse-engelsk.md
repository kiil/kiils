Jeg bed chatGPT oversætte den tekst, som jeg tidligere fik chatGPT til at udføre en ordfrekvens analyse på, til engelsk.

Af en eller anden grund oversatte den kun cirka to-tredjedele.


**Prompt:** please perform a word frequency analysis on the text from my next prompt. list the ten most used word and the frequency of each

**chatGPT:** In order to perform a word frequency analysis, I'll need some text to analyze. Please provide the text you'd like me to analyze, and I'll be happy to run the analysis and give you a list of the top ten most used words and their frequencies.

Jeg indsætter så den oversatte tekst og venter.


Den oversatte tekst kan du se her:

```
Obituary for a conspiracy theorist - Are you playing with fire?

I often starts innocently enough.

You discover that mainstream media is lying. Or maybe they're not lying exactly. But they're manipulating, you think.

They're leaving out some details from their stories and emphasizing others in a suspicious way.

And you know what? - You're right!

Maybe you start imagining that others are against you and yours. Maybe mainstream media is in cahoots with the pharmaceutical industry.

Maybe the former creates an artificial demand for the latter's products - maybe the former doesn't tell you that there are alternatives to the latter's products.

And what about the education system? Has it too been allowed to "shape" you in the wrong way. Maybe much of what you previously took for granted is wrong. Maybe much of what you've been fed is lies and nonsense by an elite who has filled you up in order to remote control you as if you were just a piece in their game.

You become skeptical and contrarian. Suspicious of everything and everyone. At the same time, you get a heady feeling of being one of the few who has figured out how things really fit together.

You start creating your own worldview. You connect different events with secret and closed networks of powerful people.

You find others who have also figured out how the world is put together beneath the surface.

The things that happen are not random. Someone is pulling the strings.

It gives order to the world and security to your mind. And it gives meaning to existence to have an enemy to fight against.

You confirm each other that your alternative worldview is the correct one. Your critical searchlight is constantly directed towards mainstream and normies. The others.

It does not occur to you to examine your own position. You do not test the ice - you are constantly trying to rip the mask off the opponent. The ground you stand on is taken as the only given.

As criticism of mainstream increases, you yourself almost imperceptibly accept increasingly peculiar positions and views as part of your own alternative worldview.

Suddenly one day there is a powerful man who apparently takes you and yours seriously. Your peers tell you he is your savior.

That a powerful man should be your savior and not primarily interested in his own position in the world, does not quite fit with your otherwise skeptical approach to the world around you. But the religious aspect in your worldview creates room for such an exception - a savior who is different from all the others.
