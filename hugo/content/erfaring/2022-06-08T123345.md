	nftables is the modern Linux kernel packet classification framework. New code should use it instead of the legacy {ip,ip6,arp,eb}_tables (xtables) infrastructure. For existing codebases that have not yet converted, the legacy xtables infrastructure is still maintained as of 2021. Automated tools assist the xtables to nftables conversion process.


	Netfilter is a framework provided by the Linux kernel that allows various networking-related operations to be implemented in the form of customized handlers. Netfilter offers various functions and operations for packet filtering, network address translation, and port translation, which provide the functionality required for directing packets through a network and prohibiting packets from reaching sensitive locations within a network.

Netfilter represents a set of hooks inside the Linux kernel, allowing specific kernel modules to register callback functions with the kernel's networking stack. Those functions, usually applied to the traffic in the form of filtering and modification rules, are called for every packet that traverses the respective hook within the networking stack.[3]
