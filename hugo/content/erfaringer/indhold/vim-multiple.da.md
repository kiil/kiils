Just like any browser, you can also use tabs within Vim. This makes it incredibly easy to switch between multiple files while you're making some code changes instead of working in one single file, closing it, and opening a new one. Below are some useful Vim commands for using tab pages:

:tabedit file - opens a new tab and will take you to edit "file"

gt - move to the next tab

gT - move to the previous tab

#gt - move to a specific tab number (e.g. 2gt takes you to the second tab)

:tabs - list all open tabs

:tabclose - close a single tab
