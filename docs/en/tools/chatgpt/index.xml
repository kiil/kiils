      <description>The other day I posted a few lines on Facebook.
My intention was to point out what can be called perspective - that a case can be seen from several angles.
Specifically, it was about &amp;ldquo;Store Bededag&amp;rdquo; and the many other more or less official holidays that spring offers in Denmark. And there are a lot of them.
My point was that for a self-employed person who works from home, these could well be perceived as interruptions.</description>

      <description>Recently I installed Marvin . Now, Marvin also happens to be the name of a dog dear to our family.
So my kids kind of feel strongly about the name, and were both a bit offended about an Artificial Intelligence with the same name.
But in this case Marvin is a
batteries-included library for building AI-powered software. Marvin&amp;rsquo;s job is to integrate AI directly into your codebase by making it look and feel like any other function.</description>

      <description>Me: is chatgpt really just a glorified markov chain
ChatGPT:
ChatGPT is a type of language model that is based on the transformer architecture, which is a neural network-based approach to natural language processing. While the Markov Chain is a mathematical model that can be used to generate text, it is a relatively simple model compared to neural network-based models like ChatGPT.
ChatGPT is trained on a massive amount of text data and uses a deep neural network with multiple layers to learn patterns in the data.</description>
