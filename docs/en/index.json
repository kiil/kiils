This layer makes it easy to give your users or customers an interaction with your payment implementation that is both simple to use and complete with regards to functionality.\nHere is some of it on Folkets:\n Servicebot on Folkets   I needed, for example, functionality where a user could download invoices past and present, since I am planning to do more B2B, and companies need the invoice for their bookkeeping.\nAt the same time I did not want a cluttered or complicated user interface that could be off putting to non-business customers.\nServicebot.io made it easy for me to achieve both of these objectives.\nBut what really set Servicebot aside, was the service they provided during the transition from my old payment layer to the new one they offered.\nAny issue or request, that I had, was taken seriously. They were always replying within a few hours, in spite of the fact that we are on opposite ends of the Atlantic ocean.\nMaybe the extraordinary responsiveness and service is due in part to the relatively small team behind the service, but it is a level of customer service I think every company should strive for regardless of size.\nServicebot.io has my highest recommendation.\nHere is a video of it live on Folkets:\n  "
