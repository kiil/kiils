        "content": "Recently I installed Marvin . Now, Marvin also happens to be the name of a dog dear to our family.\nSo my kids kind of feel strongly about the name, and were both a bit offended about an Artificial Intelligence with the same name.\nBut in this case Marvin is a\nbatteries-included library for building AI-powered software. Marvin\u0026rsquo;s job is to integrate AI directly into your codebase by making it look and feel like any other function. Marvin is building the gears, cranks, and pistons to let mechanical software systems integrate with and leverage the raw power of Large Language Models.\nTo test out this piece of software, I asked it to construct various bots for me.\nMarvin makes it easy to construct bots with different names, AI personalities and instructions.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve found it difficult to get ChatGPT to be humorous. But I gave it a go again with Marvin after I asked it to construct a bot capable of making cringy dad jokes.\nAfter constructing the bot I gave it this prompt:\nMe: give me some tricks to make me son laugh with emojis\nMarvin responded:\n🍍 + 🍰 = Pineapple upside-down cake 🤣 🧀 + 🥚 = Cheesy egg 🤪 🐘 + 🎂 = Elephant birthday cake 🤣 🐱 + 🎹 = Keyboard cat 🤪 🐷 + 🌽 = Corn on the hog 😆 My son did not find that amusing at all.\nThe thing is, though, I happen to know a lot more about my son than Marvin does. So I gave et a bit of context:\nMe: hi is ten years old and likes to play soccer please try with that again\nOf course! Here are some soccer-themed emoji combinations that might make your 10-year-old son laugh:\n⚽ + 🐶 = Doggy goal 🐾 🥅 + 💩 = Goalpost accident 😂 🦶 + 🥔 = Potato foot 🤣 🕺 + ⚽ = Soccer dance party 🎉 🥅 + 🕷️ = Spider goalie 🕸️ I hope these make your son laugh and bring a smile to his face!\nThose really made my son smile. And number two and number three made him LOL.\nSo, why am I writing a blog post about this?\nBecause I am interested in the intersection between Artificial Intelligence, language and \u0026ldquo;soul\u0026rdquo;.\nI starting to think about this question:\nHow much does an AI need to know about us to make an ongoing interaction worthwhile?\nGiving a bot a \u0026ldquo;personality\u0026rdquo; is one thing.\nRevealing your own innermost life to the bot?\nThat is something else entirely.\nBut this is exactly what will start to happen. Now.\nBonus:\nCringeDadBot: I\u0026rsquo;m here to brighten your day with some terrible dad jokes. Just ask me to tell you a joke, and I\u0026rsquo;ll do my best to make you groan. If you want to stop the jokes, just say \u0026lsquo;stop\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;bye\u0026rsquo;. Let\u0026rsquo;s have some fun!\nME: tell me a joke about a dad who always uses chatgpt and thinks he will get rich but never gets rich\nCringeDadBot: Why did the dad keep using chatgpt to try and get rich?\nBecause he thought it was a text-to-coin converter!\n"

        "content": "Me: is chatgpt really just a glorified markov chain\nChatGPT:\nChatGPT is a type of language model that is based on the transformer architecture, which is a neural network-based approach to natural language processing. While the Markov Chain is a mathematical model that can be used to generate text, it is a relatively simple model compared to neural network-based models like ChatGPT.\nChatGPT is trained on a massive amount of text data and uses a deep neural network with multiple layers to learn patterns in the data. The model is trained to predict the next word in a sentence based on the context of the previous words. This allows ChatGPT to generate text that is more coherent and semantically meaningful than text generated by a simple Markov Chain.\nMarkov Chain, on the other hand, is a statistical model that uses a set of states and transition probabilities to predict the next state in a sequence. It is trained on a smaller amount of data compared to neural network-based models like ChatGPT and generates text based on the probability of certain words or phrases following others.\nIn summary, ChatGPT is a much more advanced and sophisticated model than a simple Markov Chain, and can generate text that is more coherent, contextually appropriate, and human-like.\nMe: how does a markov chain differ from \u0026ldquo;deep learning\u0026rdquo; in neural networks\nChatGPT:\nMarkov Chain and deep learning neural network are two different approaches to modeling and generating sequences of data, such as text.\nA Markov Chain is a mathematical model that uses a set of states and transition probabilities to predict the next state in a sequence. It is trained on a relatively small amount of data and generates text by predicting the next word or phrase based on the probability of certain words or phrases following others. Markov Chain models are simple and computationally efficient, but they are limited in their ability to capture complex patterns and relationships in the data.\nDeep learning neural networks, on the other hand, are a type of machine learning that uses multi-layered neural networks to learn patterns in data. These models are trained on a large amount of data and are able to automatically learn representations of the data that can be used to generate text or other sequences. They are more powerful and flexible than Markov Chain models as they can learn a wide range of features and patterns in the data, and can also be used to perform a wide range of natural language processing tasks such as language translation, text summarization, and sentiment analysis.\nIn summary, Markov Chain is a simpler model compared to deep learning neural network, but deep learning neural networks are more powerful and flexible. They are able to learn more complex patterns in data and can be used to perform a wide range of natural language processing tasks.\n"

This layer makes it easy to give your users or customers an interaction with your payment implementation that is both simple to use and complete with regards to functionality.\nHere is some of it on Folkets:\nServicebot on Folkets I needed, for example, functionality where a user could download invoices past and present, since I am planning to do more B2B, and companies need the invoice for their bookkeeping.\nAt the same time I did not want a cluttered or complicated user interface that could be off putting to non-business customers.\nServicebot.io made it easy for me to achieve both of these objectives.\nBut what really set Servicebot aside, was the service they provided during the transition from my old payment layer to the new one they offered.\nAny issue or request, that I had, was taken seriously. They were always replying within a few hours, in spite of the fact that we are on opposite ends of the Atlantic ocean.\nMaybe the extraordinary responsiveness and service is due in part to the relatively small team behind the service, but it is a level of customer service I think every company should strive for regardless of size.\nServicebot.io has my highest recommendation.\nHere is a video of it live on Folkets:\n"
